Tech Flashcards for Kids

Tech Flashcards for Kids is an interactive app designed to help children enhance their software knowledge through fun and engaging flashcards. The app covers fundamental programming concepts, coding languages, and tech terminology, making learning both enjoyable and effective. With colorful graphics, quizzes, and progress tracking, Tech Flashcards for Kids is the perfect tool to foster a love for technology and build a strong foundation in software development from a young age.

This was a project created in under 24 hours with Chris Lonz. We successfully developed an intuitive and user-friendly interface, incorporated a wide range of software topics, and ensured the app was both educational and entertaining for young learners.
